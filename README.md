<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (
Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five
years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part
of patients’ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing
all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being
cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a
third expert.

* https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification

### Prerequisites

Hardware platform:

* NVIDIA Tesla M40 24GB for inference usage
* AMD 6900XT 16GB for Pytorch ROCm[HIP] for training usage

Software platform:

* NVIDIA SDK: TensorRT/CUDA/CuDNN
* Python environment: Anaconda
* Deep learning framework: Pytorch
* OS: Arch Linux

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Workflow

### Model training

The model[tf_efficientnet_b4_ns] structure is list as following:

This model is trained using Pytorch-ROCm.
The training result can reach 99% precision.
After training, the weight is saved to the .pt file.
* O0 level: average runtime = 49.1722163 seconds
* O1 level: average runtime = 48.22872197 seconds
* O2 level: average runtime =  46.96123036 seconds
* O3 level: average runtime = 47.74122603 seconds

### Export to ONNX file

Reload the .pt file to construct the original Pytorch model.
Export the pytorch model to the .onnx format using following code snippet.

```python
# https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html
# Input to the model
input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, 1, 224, 224, requires_grad=True)
output_data = torch_model(input)
output_file_name = "target.onnx"
# Export the model
torch.onnx.export(torch_model,  # model being run
                  input_data,  # model input (or a tuple for multiple inputs)
                  output_file_name,  # where to save the model (can be a file or file-like object)
                  export_params=True,  # store the trained parameter weights inside the model file
                  opset_version=10,  # the ONNX version to export the model to
                  do_constant_folding=True,  # whether to execute constant folding for optimization
                  input_names=['input'],  # the model's input names
                  output_names=['output'],  # the model's output names
                  dynamic_axes={'input': {0: 'batch_size'},  # variable length axes
                                'output': {0: 'batch_size'}})

```

Once the exporting is done, we can load the .onnx file for validation purpose.
The following snippet is used to load the .onnx file and use it as the inference engine.

```python
import onnx

onnx_model = onnx.load("super_resolution.onnx")
onnx.checker.check_model(onnx_model)

import onnxruntime

ort_session = onnxruntime.InferenceSession("super_resolution.onnx")


def to_numpy(tensor):
  return tensor.detach().cpu().numpy() if tensor.requires_grad else tensor.cpu().numpy()


# compute ONNX Runtime output prediction
ort_inputs = {ort_session.get_inputs()[0].name: to_numpy(x)}
ort_outs = ort_session.run(None, ort_inputs)
# compare ONNX Runtime and PyTorch results
np.testing.assert_allclose(to_numpy(torch_out), ort_outs[0], rtol=1e-03, atol=1e-05)
print("Exported model has been tested with ONNXRuntime, and the result looks good!")

```

### Export to TensorRT engine file

Once the conversion and validation for the .onnx file is done,
we can convert it to the TensorRT engine at this point.
Once the TensorRT engine is generated, we run the test again to make sure its precision keeps.

In our experiment setup, all INT8/FP16/TF32/FP32 configuration remains at 99% precision.
Note: If the selected precision is INT8, the calibrator dataset should be provided.

### Engine file size comparison

* classifier-sim.INT8.engine = 6.3M
* classifier-sim.FP16.engine = 3.2M
* classifier-sim.FP32.engine = 3.2M
* classifier-sim.TF32.engine = 3.2M

### Performance evaluation

The performance evaluation is done using a Tesla M40 card.

### Accuracy evaluation


* Run loss on test dataset for classifier-sim.INT8.engine=18.15721794217825
* Run loss on test dataset for classifier-sim.FP16.engine=18.15721845626831
* Run loss on test dataset for classifier-sim.TF32.engine=18.157218277454376
* Run loss on test dataset for classifier-sim.FP32.engine=18.157218001782894



### Conclusion:

1. The file size of classifier-sim.INT8.engine is almost double as other engine files. This needs further investigation.
2. In term of accuracy, four engines are very close, which means quantization causes negligible accuracy loss.
3. The FP16 quantization has the best performance, which is slightly better than others.
